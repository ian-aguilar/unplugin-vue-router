# Why?

This project idea came from trying [to type the router directly using Typescript](https://github.com/vuejs/router/pull/1397/commits/a7c591b6fd5d8478ba3f87e833514bc0e30f93a9), finding out it's not fast enough to be pleasant to use and, ending up using build-based tools, taking some inspiration from other projects like:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) - The Vue.js Framework
- [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) - Framework agnostic file based routing
- [Typed Router for Nuxt](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/nuxt-typed-router) - A module to add typed routing to Nuxt

It's currently included as [an experimental setting in Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/experimental-features#typedpages).
