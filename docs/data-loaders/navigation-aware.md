# Navigation aware

## Controlling the navigation with `NavigationResult`

## Consistent updates

## Lazy loaders

## Loading after the navigation

It's possible to not start loading the data until the navigation is done. To do this, simply [**do not attach the loader to the page**](./defining-loaders.md#disconnecting-a-loader-from-a-page). It will eventually start loading when the page is mounted.
